# ADHDassist
An ADHD-oriented to-do list program, perfect for those who need to organize themselves to get things done!

**Version: 1.0.0**

*Built by Berea College sophomore Alys Combs*

This is a program that I made because I struggle with task-management. I've found that my brain works best when I divide the things I need to do into tasks,
their subtasks, and everything that goes into getting them done. So, I made a to-do list that organizes your 'to-do's with that setup! I decided to share it
here for anyone on GitHub who happens to stumble across it so that maybe it'll help your brain the way that it helps mine. If you use the program and find
that there could be improvements or other things that you like to see, I encourage you to share your ideas with me! I apologize if this project isn't the
cleanest, but it is something I am proud of as a student dipping their toes into the wide ocean of computer science. Enjoy!
